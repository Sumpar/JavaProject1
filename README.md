# JavaProject1
This is my Java project

I have planned first before coding so I have general idea where to start and how to structure the code and this was my initial planning.

Make Gui classes. probably 5. 
	1 screen = Choose between type in or choose the selected file or add in the new informal word or exit.(Main menu)
	2 screen = Type in the text. and press yes or go back (error checker for the text - make sure its not empty) 
	3 screen = Choose the file. and press yes (error checker for the file type just in case if its not txt file) 
	4 screen = add in the informal word to the system reader(dictionary - text file) so that it could recognize those words in future. and the menu key(go back)(need a error checker make sure the typed in thing isnt just space or it is already implemented or not)

Make 2 classes for texts(file reading/type in texts) (may not need 2 classes - check it later)

Having an another set of text file to read in the bad languages having commas or smth to check between them (compare one by one to the text/file) 
counter needed for counting informal words(needs dictionary).

Need a thing to check the sentence sizes.
	if it is a text file need a counter. counter for words between words. if its long -> above some range thats set -> counter++ / if its short -> below some range thats set -> another counter++
	if it is typed in it needs boolean (short or no)

Need a words size (check for spaces between words)
	having a counter for this. (need to find out how to compare) needs average.


extends the ideas/differences between formals/informals using website thats saved.


Sequences
	- Actual first screen (screen class)
	- Dictionary (txt)
	- Add in informal word screen (Screen class)
	- Type in text Gui (screen class)(needs class implements for data)
	- Output for the text Gui (screen class)(check if it works)
	- Choose the file (screen class)(needs class implemnets for data)
	- Output for the file Gui (screen class)(check if it works)
	- Extends idea
	
	
	
I tried to follow my planning although I had to change some parts because it was needed to be changed.
